# LIFEDEX - Fullstack Dockerized

The Lifedex is a journal encyclopedia application, which is capable of analyzing and retaining information of the things you encounter through life.

Entries are added to the Lifedex simply by capturing a photo of the item, which is analyzed by our ML models to get descriptive information about the elements in the photo and stored for later reference. As you capture more of the encounters you get, you level up along with the experience you gain!
